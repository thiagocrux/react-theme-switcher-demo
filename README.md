# React Theme Switcher POC

A proof of concept of a theme switcher made with React and TypeScript.

## Technologies

These are some of the tecnologies used in this project:

- `prettier`: A code formatter.
- `react`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.
- `styled-components`: A library for React and React Native that allows you to use component-level styles in your application.
- `typescript`: A superset of JavaScript that introduces optional static typing, interfaces, enums, and other language features.
